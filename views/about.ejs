    <p id="merry">I've been a book enthusiast as long as I can remember. From a young age I've been reading books to improve my vocabulary. From Geronimo Stilton to 
        Da Vinci Code, I've had my favourites. Thrillers are mostly my favourite. This website is created to track my book reading journey. Happy Reading!
